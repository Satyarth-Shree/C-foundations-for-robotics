# 01 â€“ Basic Beginner Codes

This folder contains my earliest C programming practice files.

### ğŸ“Œ Objectives

I have chosen to begin my programming journey with the C language because:

- It builds a strong foundation in programming logic and problem-solving.
- C is the core language used in embedded systems, robotics, and microcontroller programming.
- Mastering C will help me transition smoothly into C++, Arduino, and real-world robotics applications.

> ğŸ’¡ This folder marks the first step in my journey toward becoming a robotics and embedded systems engineer.
