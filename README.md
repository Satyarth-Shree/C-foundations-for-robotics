# C Foundations for Robotics

Welcome to my journey of mastering the C programming language — a foundational step toward becoming a skilled robotics and embedded systems engineer.

## 🚀 Why This Repository?

As an incoming B.Tech student in Robotics and Automation at Lovely Professional University (LPU), I’m starting early to build a strong foundation in low-level programming. This repository documents my self-paced learning and hands-on practice in C, which is essential for embedded systems and robotics.

## 🧑‍💻 What You’ll Find Here?

This repository is a growing collection of C programs I write as I learn — from basic to intermediate concepts. The programs may not follow a fixed curriculum order, but they are:
- Practiced using **Code::Blocks** IDE
- Committed frequently to show my learning progress
- Written with meaningful filenames and comments
- Meant to serve as personal notes and reference

Whether it's a simple `hello world` or pointer arithmetic, each file reflects my understanding at that stage.

## 📈 Long-Term Goal

By building this strong foundation in C, I aim to:
- Transition smoothly into learning C++
- Work confidently with **Arduino**, **microcontrollers**, and **real-time systems**
- Design robotic systems that interact with the physical world
